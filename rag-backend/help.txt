Steps to Build the Application:

1. Extract Text from PDF:
Use a library like PyPDF2, pdfminer.six, or PyMuPDF to extract text from PDF files.

2.Text Preprocessing:
Clean the text to remove special characters, unnecessary spaces, or irrelevant sections.
Split the text into smaller chunks (e.g., paragraphs or sentences) with overlapping windows for better context retrieval.

3.Embedding the Text:
Use a pre-trained language model (e.g., OpenAI's embeddings, Sentence-BERT, or Hugging Face models) to convert text chunks into vector embeddings.

4.Storing Embeddings Locally:
Use a vector database like FAISS or a simple local storage mechanism to store embeddings.

5.Query Processing:
Convert user queries into embeddings using the same model.
Use a similarity search (e.g., cosine similarity) to find the most relevant chunks of text.

6.Generate Answers:
Fine-tune or use a pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT) to generate answers based on the retrieved context.

7.Create an Offline Interface:
Develop a user-friendly interface using frameworks like Flask (Python) for desktop apps or Electron.js for cross-platform support.
